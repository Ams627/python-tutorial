= Python Tutorial

WARNING: This tutorial is for Python 3 - if, for some reason, you need to learn Python 2, you should look elsewhere.

== Hello World

Like BASIC of old, Python uses the print function to write text to the terminal/console:

[source,python]
----
print("Hello, World!")
----

Notes:

* Python is case-sensitive, so `Print("Hello, World!")` does not work.
* You can use single or double-quotes `Print('Hello, World!') is equally valid.
* A newline is automatically appended.
* You can prevent the newline being appended by adding `,end=""`: +

[source,python]
----
print("Hello, World!", end="")
----
+
You can use any string for `end` and include a newline by using '\r' if you want.

=== stderr

You can write output to the standard error using one of two different methods:

[source,python]
----
import sys
print("Hello, World!", file=sys.stderr)
sys.stderr.write('Hello')
----

== Comments

Comments start with a hash `#` character and continue until the end of the line.

== Variables

Variables cannot be declared before use. Just use them!

----
a = 1
b = 2.5
c = 3+4j # complex number type
Î± = 3.5
----

=== Numeric types

There is one integer type `int` which can be arbitrarily large. There is one floating point type: `float`.

There is a complex type - complex literals use `j` rather than `i`: `3+4j`:

----
a = 3+4j
print(abs(a))
print(a.real)
print(a.imag)
----

Note that `abs(a)` give the modulus of a complex number.

=== Strings

Strings can use double or single quotes. Use `f` before a string for interpolation (like a `$` in C#).

----
s1 = 'hello'
name = 'jim'
s2 = f'hello {name}'
----

Strings can be added:

----
s1 ='hello'
s2 = s1 + ' world'
----

and compared:

----
s1 ='hello'
s2 = 'world'
s2 < s1
s1 == s2
----

== Maths functions:

----
import math
math.log2(1000)
math.sin(30 * math.pi / 180)
----

Or if you have long complex expressions and wish to avoid the `math` prefix, use the following:

----
from math import sin, cos, tan, log2, pi
a = sin(0.2) + cos(0.3) + tan(0.4) + log2(1000) * pi
----

Most mathematical functions found in other languages are available but math also includes gamma functions, error functions,
base 2 logarithm, logarithm of an arbitrary base, factorials and the converters `radians` and `degrees`.


== Python operators

Python has most of the operators available in C-like languages with some notable differences:

* Python does not have increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators.
* Python has an exponentiation operator `**` ("to the power of").
* Python has a "floor division" operator `//` such that `5.0 // 2.0` is `2`.
* Python logical operators are spelled `and`, `or` and `not` - **the usual C-like operators `&&`, `||` and `!` are not used**.
* Python includes the sequence membership operators `in` and `not in`.


== Control structures

=== Indenting

Statements are grouped using indenting instead of curly brackets like in other languages.

=== Conditions

Colons are used to **terminate** conditions in Python.

=== `if` statement

----
a = 33
b = 34

if a > b:
    print("a is the biggest")
----

Note that brackets around the condition are not required and are discouraged.

=== `elif`

`elif` is use instead of the more common `else if` found in some languages.

----
a = 33
b = 34

if a > b:
    print("a is the biggest")
elif b > a:
    print("b is the biggest")
else:
    print("a and b are the same")
----

WARNING: Note the colon after `else`.

=== Short `if` and short `else`

A single statement following if may be placed on one line:

----
if a > b: print("a is the biggest")
----

A short `else` resembles the ternary operator in C-like languages:

----
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")
----


== Loops

=== `for` loop

----
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
for prime in primes:
    print(prime)
----

=== Range based `for` loop

=== `while` loop

== Collection types

Python directly supports lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries.

=== lists

Lists use square brackets:

----
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(mylist[1]) # banana
----

Lists can be indexed with a negative number: `mylist[-1]` means the last item in the list.

You can use a range to extract a sub-list: `[2:5]` means get everything from item 2 to item 5.

----
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:5]) # ['cherry', 'orange', 'kiwi']
----

=== tuples

Tuples use round brackets:

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(mytuple)

Use `len` to find the number of members of a tuple:

----
print(len(thistuple))
----

More examples:

----
tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)
tuple3 = (True, False, False)
----

=== Sets

Sets use **curly brackets**:

----
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
----

* Sets are **unordered** and never contain duplicates.
* You cannot use an index into a set.
* You can get the length of a set with `len`
* You cannot change an item in a set but you can add new items with `add`: `myset.Add("kiwi")`
* You can remove an item from a set with `remove`: `myset.remove("apple")`
* You can add any `iterable` to a set with `update`, for example: +
----
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
mylist = ["kiwi", "orange"]

thisset.update(mylist)
----

=== Dictionaries

Dictionaries use **curly brackets** like sets do and contain key-value pairs. The difference
between a set and a dictionary is that the dictionary contains `key-value` pairs - a key-value
is separate from the value by a **colon**.

----
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
----

WARNING: From Python 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. Before Python 3.7 they were unordered.

* Dictionary items must have a unique key - adding a key-value pair with the same key as a pair already in the
dictionary will overwrite the first pair.
* Dictionary length can be obtain with `len(dictionary)`.
* To test if a key is in a dictionary use the `in` operator. (Python 2 had `has_key` but this has been removed from Python 3).
* The `keys` method will obtain a list of the dictionary's keys.
* The `values` method will obtain a list of the dictionary's values.
* The `get` method retrieves a value for a key from a dictionary but returns `None` if the key does not exist.
